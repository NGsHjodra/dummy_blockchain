# ðŸŽ“ Blockchain Certificate System (PoA)

This system uses a lightweight Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchain to issue and verify graduation certificates securely.

---

## System Flow
```
user     â†’ manually sends public key to the university

uni      â†’ creates transactions after graduation
         â†’ Signs transactions with its private key
         â†’ sends transactions to the network

network  â†’ receives transaction (on_transaction_received)
         â†’ verifies signature
         â†’ gossip transaction to peers

validator â†’ receives transaction

proposer â†’ checks if itâ€™s their turn (round-robin)
         â†’ collects TXs 
         â†’ creates a block
         â†’ signs and broadcasts a block to the validator set

validator â†’ receives block
          â†’ verifies block + TXs
          â†’ signs the vote and sends it to the proposer

proposer â†’ collects votes
         â†’ if threshold met â†’ commits block
         â†’ broadcasts a committed block

user     â†’ receives certificate (check view_transaction.py)
```


# How to run the code

## 1. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 2. Run the code

### 2.1. Run main.py
```
python main.py
```
### 2.2. Run send_transaction.py
```
python send_transaction.py
```
### 2.3. Run view_transaction.py
```
python view_transaction.py
```
### 2.4. Run view_chain.py
```
python view_chain.py
```

## Optionally, you can change the port number in view_block.py and view_transaction.py from 8080 to 8084 to check the block and transaction for the other nodes.
